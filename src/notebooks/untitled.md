# Discrete Event Simulation


## SimPy toy example
- open source MIT licence
- based on generators

Environment (use this) / RealtimeEnvironment

request resource and yield after they're complete



Simpy works off of generators


timeout event -> allow you to suspend process for certain amount of time on simulation clock before resuming

timeout event - waits until complete and resumes
